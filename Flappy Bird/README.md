</p>

A simple **Flappy Bird clone** built using **Python and Pygame** — with smooth animations, coin pickups, multiple sound effects, and authentic one-tap physics.

## 🎮 What is Flappy Bird?

> Tap **SPACE** to flap. Navigate the bird through endless pipes without crashing. Collect coins between pipes for bonus points. Survive as long as possible to set a new high score.

---

## 🌟 Features

- 🐤 Smooth bird flapping animation (wing up / wing down state)
- 🎵 Five distinct sound effects (flap, point, hit, die, swoosh)
- 💥 Pixel-perfect collision detection
- 🪙 Random coin pickups worth **+5 points**
- ☁️ Parallax-scrolling clouds
- 🚧 Procedurally generated pipe heights
- 📈 Real-time score tracking
- 🎮 Classic Flappy Bird one-tap mechanics

## 🕹️ Game Loop Overview

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([🚀 Start Game]) --> Init[Initialize PyGame + Load Sounds/Sprites]
    Init --> Idle{Bird Idle on Start Screen?}
    Idle -- "Press SPACE" --> Play[Begin Gameplay]
    Play --> Gravity[Apply Gravity + Move Pipes Left]
    Gravity --> Collide{Collision with Pipe / Floor / Ceiling?}
    Collide -- "Yes" --> Death[Play Hit + Die Sound]
    Death --> Over[Show YOU LOSE + Final Score]
    Over --> Wait[Wait 5 seconds]
    Wait --> Exit([❌ Exit Process])

    Collide -- "No" --> Coin{Coin Collision?}
    Coin -- "Yes" --> Score[+5 Bonus, Hide Coin]
    Coin -- "No" --> Pass{Passed Pipe?}
    Pass -- "Yes" --> AddScore[+1 Score, Play Point Sound]
    Pass -- "No" --> Render
    Score --> Render[Render Frame]
    AddScore --> Render

## 🐦 Bird Physics

    participant Game

    User->>Game: Press SPACE
    Game->>Bird: velocity = -7  (instant flap up)
    Note over Bird: gravity = +0.4 / frame

    loop Every Frame
        Bird->>Bird: velocity += gravity
        Bird->>Bird: bird_y += velocity
    end

    User->>Game: Press SPACE again
    Game->>Bird: velocity = -7  (re-flap)
```
